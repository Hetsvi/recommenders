Lets leave the veracity aside for a moment - always a touchy subject when it comes to real life stories of the occult - and talk about the contents. \n The Black Alchemist covers a period of two years in which Collins, a magician, and Bernard, a psychic, undertook a series of psychic quests that put them in opposition with the titular Black Alchemist. As entertainment goes, the combination of harrowing discoveries, ancient lore, and going down the pub for a cigarette and a Guinness, trying to make sense of it all while a hen party screams at each other, is a winner. It is simultaneously down to earth and out of this world. \n It reads fast, both because of the curiousity and because Collins has a very clear writing style. Sometimes its a little clunky or over repetitive and there's a few meetings that get underreported, but I am very much quibbling here. Mostly important, he captures his own and Bernard's sense of wonder, awe and occasionally revulsion enough that I shared them.", 'rating': 5, 'genreID': 2, 'genre': 'fantasy_paranormal'}

I loved how everything just keeps going and how the power play is depicted so explicitly! Amazing writing throughout! \n I really loved the new characters this sequel brought in! I loved the rest of the Victors, especially Finnick and Johanna! They were all pretty amazing characters! \n I loved how deep Everllark has gotten! I'm just soooo Team Peeta! He so deserves Katniss and they're just so perfect for each other! Gale never hits the right vibe with me! I'm never inclined to think that maybe he should end up with Katniss. Never. He's more of the freedom fighter image than a lover. \n And I love how Katniss is! I love how she just fights through and perseveres on! I so need more of the Girl on Fire! \n And that ending was phenomenal! I loved how Katniss's love towards Peeta was portrayed in that last chapter! I'm so glad that Finnick's alright, but I'm so hoping that Johanna and Peeta are OK! \n Can't wait to move on to Book 3!!!", 'rating': 5, 'genreID': 4, 'genre': 'young_adult'}

I finished the novel in about two days and just could not put it down, really. For young adult fiction, it is the great mix of issues all teens and young adults bear at some point in their lives. \n The issues are loss, grief and suffering but Green handles these kinda tough issues with good sense of humor and perfect compassion for all individuals involved. This is a must read for anyone who is going through an approaching of age experience as high school junior Miles Halter, the main character, whom he is a friendless Floridian who begged his parents to enroll him in the Culver Creek boarding school. Miles dreams of starting fresh at his elite Alabama prep school. \n At school, he falls in with a prankster of a roommate, the Colonel, and the sexy yet messed-up Alaska Young. For an unforgettable 128 days, Miles learns life lessons in loyalty, friendship, love, literature, and poetry, as well as experiences the sensation of having a first girlfriend. When tragedy happens at Culver Creek, Miles is forced to undertake an even closer examination of his own character and relationship with his friends. \n Afterall, this book is indeed a great book! I just gave 4 out of 5 because i don't really like the ending. Yet, it's a very good novel to read since there are so so many lessons involved.", 'rating': 4, 'genreID': 4, 'genre': 'young_adult'}

I loved the Sevenwaters series so much and being that it was written for an adult audience the stories were much more complicated and interesting. I think I was a little disappointed in this one because the story seemed very slow in the first half- later it defintely picked up and I didn't want to put it down. I did really like the premise behind the book and will read the next one.", 'rating': 3, 'genreID': 2, 'genre': 'fantasy_paranormal'
